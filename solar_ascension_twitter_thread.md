### Tweet 1/15 - HOOK
‚òÄÔ∏è AMERICA IS ABOUT TO BECOME THE SUN KINGDOM OF EARTH üåü

We're not just going solar‚Äîwe're going to OWN the sun.

A thread on how America will become the world's first fully solar-powered nation and use it to:
‚Ä¢ Pay off our $34T debt
‚Ä¢ Fund universal healthcare
‚Ä¢ Lead the global energy revolution

üßµüëá

### Tweet 2/15 - PROBLEM STATEMENT
üî• THE REALITY CHECK:

‚Ä¢ We're $34 TRILLION in debt
‚Ä¢ Dependent on foreign energy
‚Ä¢ China leads solar manufacturing
‚Ä¢ Climate crisis accelerating

But here's the thing: China has what we need, and we have what they want.

It's time for a BOLD partnership, not petty competition.

### Tweet 3/15 - THE VISION
‚ö°Ô∏è PROJECT SOLAR ASCENSION: PHASE I

We partner with China (yes, China) because:
‚Ä¢ They make 80% of global solar panels
‚Ä¢ They have the battery technology
‚Ä¢ They have the manufacturing scale

We create a "Solar Bridge Accord" - fair tech transfer, joint development, mutual prosperity.

Bold? Yes. Necessary? Absolutely.

### Tweet 4/15 - THE SCALE
üèóÔ∏è PHASE II: THE DEPLOYMENT

‚Ä¢ 10 MILLION acres of federal land ‚Üí solar farms
‚Ä¢ 500+ GIGAWATTS of solar generation
‚Ä¢ Every new building ‚Üí solar + battery mandatory
‚Ä¢ Every highway ‚Üí solar panels + EV chargers
‚Ä¢ 100% subsidized home solar retrofits

This isn't incremental change.
This is REVOLUTION.

### Tweet 5/15 - THE MONEY
üí∞ PHASE III: PROFIT FROM THE SUN

We don't just go solar‚Äîwe go SOLAR RICH:

‚Ä¢ Sell excess energy to Canada, Mexico, Caribbean
‚Ä¢ $200+ BILLION annually in energy exports
‚Ä¢ National Solar Bonds backed by solar revenue
‚Ä¢ Every GW sold = debt reduction

The sun doesn't send us a bill.
